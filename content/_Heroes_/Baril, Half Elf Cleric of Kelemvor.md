## Original Text by Dimitris
I don't even remember my parents. I was told that I was abandoned as an infant at the entrance of a monastery of Ohgma. Nobody saw who left me there. Did my parents leave me? Are they even alive? 

The monastery is located high in the spine of the world. The monks were kind enough to take care of me and raise me.



I grew up in the monastery.

My sister, or should I say the tiefling girl that should be my sister, was also was also an orphan in the monastery. There was nothing that I could not have done for her. She was the closest thing to a family to me. We grew up together, helping the monks, knowing their ways. I trained my soul and body, but I never felt that I really belonged there.



Unfortunately, my sister grew ill when I was 9 years old. I watched her fading away like a candle blown by the wind. The monks could not help her. She died without me being able to help her. 

I promised that I will never be that weak again. I will find the secrets to life and death. I will try to bring her back.



After her death I frequently have terrible visions of death and destruction. I see the realms of death passing through my eyes.

She is always there staring at me, speechless. These dreams haunt me. I cannot find any rest. I need to know what they mean. I need to find how to stop them. I need to know what they are trying to tell me.



Unfortunately, the monks do not have the answers for me  

### Version 2


At the day of my birthday when I became 14 years old, I had my worst vision yet. I saw everything burned and destroyed. The dead matching the earth. And my sister seems to try to communicate with me. She points at the abyss, at the realm of death, at the realm of Kelemvor.

I am convinced that the clergy of Kelemvor holds all the answers that I seek. 

In the next morning I fairwelled the fair monks that I grew up with and travelled to the famous city of baldur's gate and the great temple of Kelemvor.

I joined the clergy at the temple of Kelemvor, learning his ways. I devoted my life to him, hoping to find the answers that I seek, and maybe find a way to bring my sister back.

I don't remember my parents. I was abandoned as a baby at a monastery of Ohgma, high in the Spine of the World. No one saw who left me. Did my parents abandon me? Are they still alive? The monks raised me with kindness, but I never felt like I truly belonged.

A tiefling girl, who became like a sister to me, was also an orphan at the monastery. We grew up together, helping the monks and learning their ways. But when I was nine, she fell ill. Despite the monks' efforts, she passed away, and I couldn’t save her. That moment changed me—I vowed never to be that powerless again. I began seeking the secrets of life and death, hoping to bring her back.

Since her death, I've been haunted by visions of destruction and the realm of death. My sister is always there, silently staring at me. I can't rest until I understand what these visions mean or how to stop them. But the monks had no answers.

On my 14th birthday, I had my worst vision yet—everything burned, the dead walking the earth, and my sister pointing toward the abyss and Kelemvor’s realm. I became convinced that Kelemvor's clergy holds the answers I seek.

The next morning, I bid farewell to the monks and traveled to Baldur’s Gate, joining the temple of Kelemvor. I’ve since dedicated my life to his service, hoping to uncover the truths about life, death, and maybe even bring my sister back.
